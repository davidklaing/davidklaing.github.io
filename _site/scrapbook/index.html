    content: '<div class="article-component"><h1>How to invest in index funds, for Canadians</h1><hr/><em>Last updated 2020-02-11</em><hr/><p>Several friends have told me that they’ve read enough about investing to know that it’s best for non-professional investors to use index funds. But they don’t know how. Like, literally: what buttons should they press? I’m not a financial advisor, but here’s a system that works for me, as a Canadian:</p><p>1. Open a self-directed tax-free savings account (TFSA) with TD: <a href="https://www.td.com/ca/en/investing/direct-investing/tfsa-accounts/">https://www.td.com/ca/en/investing/direct-investing/tfsa-accounts/</a></p><p>The TFSA is a great place to start because you invest after-tax income, and can withdraw tax-free. There’s nothing fancy: you just put money in, then invest, and withdraw when you want to.</p><p>2. Transfer some money into your account. I don’t know the easiest way to do this if you don’t also have a checking account with TD, but if you do, you can do it on the transfers page on EasyWeb:</p><p><img alt="" src="/assets/img/passive_investing/transfer.png"/></p><p>3. Now that you’ve added some money, go to your TFSA in WebBroker: <a href="https://webbroker.td.com">https://webbroker.td.com</a></p><p>4. Click Buy/Sell at the top of the screen:</p><p><img alt="" src="/assets/img/passive_investing/buy_sell.png"/></p><p>5. On the pop-up, go to Mutual Funds:</p><p><img alt="" src="/assets/img/passive_investing/mutual_funds.png"/></p><p>6. Decide on your portfolio: what proportion of your investments will go into which funds? Mine is adapted from the model portfolios on Canadian Couch Potato, a site that I think is the best source of information about passive investing for Canadians. Here’s the site: <a href="https://canadiancouchpotato.com">https://canadiancouchpotato.com</a></p><p>And here are the model portfolios for the TD e-Series funds, which are the ones I invest in: <a href="https://cdn.canadiancouchpotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/CCP-Model-Portfolios-TD-e-Series-2019.pdf">https://cdn.canadiancouchpotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/CCP-Model-Portfolios-TD-e-Series-2019.pdf</a></p><p>If your investment horizon is shorter (i.e. you want to withdraw this money in the next few years), choose a portfolio that has more bonds relative to stocks. If your horizon is longer, choose one with more stocks relative to bonds.</p><p>Personally, I have a shorter horizon for my TFSA (which I think of as down payment money) and a longer horizon for my RSP (which I think of as retirement money). So I have different portfolios for each.</p><p>I invest in more American and international stocks than Canadian ones, simply because those markets are larger and I want to avoid “home bias”—the tendency for investors to invest in companies from their own countries. But the best allocation for me is not necessarily the best one for you. To reiterate: I’m not a financial advisor, and if you feel more comfortable just following Canadian Couch Potato’s advice, you should do that. Really though, do your research and think it through.</p><p>If you’re interested, here’s the breakdown for my TFSA, which is quite conservative since it’s shorter-term:</p><ul><li>10% cash</li><li>15% Canadian stock index (TDB900)</li><li>20% International stock index (TDB911)</li><li>25% US stock index (TDB902)</li><li>30% Canadian bond index (TDB909)</li></ul><p>And here’s the breakdown for my RSP, which is more aggressive since it’s long-term:</p><ul><li>0% cash</li><li>20% Canadian stock index (TDB900)</li><li>30% International stock index (TDB911)</li><li>40% US stock index (TDB902)</li><li>10% Canadian bond index (TDB909)</li></ul><p>7. After deciding on your portfolio, calculate how much of your cash to invest in each fund. You can whip out your calculator and just calculate the percentages every time if you want, but:</p><p>Personally, I use a spreadsheet to rebalance my portfolio every time I add more cash. Feel free to <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OWwhZ3SmQ4fmUzL-OpPVEaLibobMznyUdAFXwQIeLn0/copy">make a copy</a> of the template, if you want to use it. Edit the values under “Current Amount” and “Target Percentage”, and everything else will update automatically.</p><p>8. Go back to the Buy &amp; Sell page on WebBroker, and search for the first fund in your list. For example:</p><p><img alt="" src="/assets/img/passive_investing/search_fund.png"/></p><p>9. For “Quantity type”, choose “Dollar Amount”:</p><p><img alt="" src="/assets/img/passive_investing/quantity_type.png"/></p><p>10. Enter the amount from the “Delta” column if you’re using my spreadsheet template, or just add however much you want to invest in this particular fund. ($100 is the minimum amount for each of these funds.)</p><p><img alt="" src="/assets/img/passive_investing/enter_amount.png"/></p><p>11. Click “Preview order”, then “Agree &amp; Send Order”:</p><p><img alt="" src="/assets/img/passive_investing/send_order.png"/></p><p>12. Profit!</p><p>This system obviously isn’t for everyone, but if you’re a Canadian who has found this stuff a bit out of reach, I hope this post has demystified a few parts of it for you.</p><p>One last time: I am not a financial advisor, and I am definitely not <em>your</em> financial advisor. But if you have any questions on the level of this nuts &amp; bolts stuff, or about my experience investing in the e-Series funds with TD’s self-directed accounts, I’m happy to help!</p><p>(PS: I know all this stuff because I’m fortunate to have a dad who worked at TD and who showed me how to do it. It’s all pretty simple once you’ve done it, but highly non-obvious if you haven’t.)</p></div>'

It’s called the “slip-box” method, so named because it originally comprised a literal box into which the notetaker would slip index cards.</p><p>The method excites me for two reasons. One: it’s a system for reflecting privately on the things I read—for checking my understanding, for improving retention of information, and for identifying questions to follow up on. Two: it’s a system for making connections between ideas. Creativity is mostly a matter of combining things in unusual ways, and the slip-box is a playground designed specifically for that.</p><p>So, what is it? Essentially, it is an incubation chamber for two types of written documents.</p><ul><li><em>Literature notes</em> are paraphrases of ideas and arguments encountered during research, complete with references.</li><li><em>Permanent notes</em> are the notetaker’s ‘original’ thoughts.</li></ul><p>Both types of notes are written in publishable-quality prose, and each note is meant to include enough detail that it could be read and understood on its own. The magic starts once you have enough notes that you can start connecting them to each other, prompting the creation of even more notes.</p><p>The inventor of the slip-box method, the German sociologist Niklas Luhmann, connected his notes manually with an intricate system of IDs. But now we have software that can manage connections for us. Enter <a href="https://roamresearch.com/">Roam Research</a>, a new note-taking power-tool that early users are going absolutely bonkers over. I too have joined the <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23roamcult">cult</a>. Roam is special for many reasons, one of which is that it’s a perfect platform for building a modern slip-box. (Roam’s founder, Conor White-Sullivan, was heavily influenced by Luhmann.)</p><p>Still, I haven’t yet seen any accounts of how to use Roam as a slip-box. Despite being new to both Roam and the slip-box method, I thought I’d share my current system.</p><p>If you aren’t familiar with Roam, you should go read Nat Eliason’s <a href="https://www.nateliason.com/blog/roam">Roam: Why I Love it and How I Use It</a>. If you want to learn more about the slip-box method, read Sönke Ahrens’ book <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34507927-how-to-take-smart-notes">How to Take Smart Notes</a> or Yuxi Liu’s <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/T382CLwAjsy3fmecf/how-to-take-smart-notes-ahrens-2017">summary of it</a>.</p><h2 id="roam-as-a-slip-box">Roam as a slip-box</h2><p>When I first started experimenting with the slip-box method in Roam, I had three questions:</p><ol><li><strong>Where should I write my notes?</strong> Should each note be its own page, or its own block? How should I manage note metadata, if at all?</li><li><strong>How should I distinguish between types of notes?</strong> How should literature notes be categorized separately from permanent notes, and how should both of them be categorized separately from other uses of Roam?</li><li><strong>How should I connect my notes to each other?</strong> By inline page links, by sub-blocks, or something else?</li></ol><p>My answers to these questions are in three Roam features:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Daily Notes pages.</strong> I write all my literature notes and permanent notes as individual blocks in my daily notes. This makes it easy to track when I wrote each note, and means that other notes or thoughts can be conveniently added in parallel without needing to bounce around between pages.</p></li><li><p><strong>Tags</strong>: I have a tag for literature notes (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">#litnote</code>) and a tag for permanent notes (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">#permnote</code>). I include these tags, as well as any relevant reference material, at the end of the relevant blocks. When I want to see all my literature notes or permanent notes together, I can go to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">litnote</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">permnote</code> pages and see them in the linked references.</p></li><li><p><strong>Block references</strong>: Roam allows inline links to other pages, but sometimes you don’t want to link a block to a whole page, but simply to another block. For this I use block references: by typing double parentheses and searching for the original block of interest, I can insert that block into my current block at any point and add whatever additional information I want to include in my new note.</p></li></ul><p>You can see me using all three of these features in my daily notes page from January 18th:</p><p><img alt="" src="/assets/img/roam_slipbox/roam_daily_note.png"/></p><p>I like this system because it makes many things easy. I can compose, categorize, connect, and track my notes all at the speed of thought, without being prevented from using Roam for other purposes.</p><p>Still, my system will surely keep evolving. I don’t consider myself a Roam poweruser, so if you are one and you have suggestions, please do send them my way.</p></div>'
