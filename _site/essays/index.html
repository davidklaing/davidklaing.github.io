After watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LAhHDEtTD0">this vlogbrothers video</a>, I started referring to this standard as my ‘aesthetic target’. At its center is my ‘aesthetic bullseye’, which represents my concept of perfection.</p><p><img alt="" src="/assets/img/aesthetic_bullseye/one_target.png"/></p><p>It’s tempting to remain unsatisfied until I hit my aesthetic bullseye. However, if I’m making something for others to enjoy, I need to consider their tastes as well as my own. And while this might seem to make my job harder, it actually makes it much easier. The reason is that not everyone’s tastes are exactly the same. If I superimpose other people’s aesthetic targets onto my own, my aesthetic bullseye disappears.</p><p><img alt="" src="/assets/img/aesthetic_bullseye/multiple_targets.png"/></p><p>Even if I hit my own bullseye, I will miss the bullseyes of others. Realizing this has helped me to relax more when I’m struggling to achieve my own standard of perfection. Better to take more shots in the right general direction than to get caught in the perfectionist’s eternal refrain of “ready, aim, aim, aim, aaaaaaim…”</p></div>'

    content: '<div class="article-component"><h1>Covers shouldn’t just be for musicians</h1><hr/><em>Last updated 2019-12-04</em><hr/><p>When aspiring musicians first learn to play their instruments, they rarely start composing their own songs immediately. Most start by learning to play the songs of others. This allows them to focus on skills like intonation, dynamics, and tempo. The skill of composition can wait until they have developed good playing technique.</p><p>By contrast, aspiring writers almost always create their own content right from the start. Have you ever heard a conversation like this?</p><blockquote><p>“I’m working on a novel.”</p><p>“Cool, what’s it about?”</p><p>“It’s Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone.”</p><p>“Oh, you mean like a fanfic?”</p><p>“No, I’m telling the story of Harry’s first year at Hogwarts.”</p><p>“But you’re not putting a spin on it or anything?”</p><p>“Nope, it’s the same as the story told in the original.”</p><p>“Word for word?”</p><p>“No, but arc for arc. Rowling’s story, my words.”</p><p>“Huh. Sort of like a cover.”</p></blockquote><p>I wish writing covers were considered totally normal. I’m not talking about adaptations, like Joyce’s <em>Ulysses</em> (an adaptation of <em>The Odyssey</em>, set in 20th century Dublin), although I would love to see more of those too. By “covers”, I mean high-fidelity recreations of other people’s written works—comprehensive paraphrases.</p><p>Writing is hard. When you’re learning to write, you have to worry about coherence, organization, and word choice. That’s a lot to keep track of. Writing covers is a great way to refine these skills without needing to worry about originality. If writing covers were normal, we could all practice more and improve faster.</p><p>There would also be better, and more niche, versions of many written works. Imagine: <em>Jane Eyre</em>, covered by J.K. Rowling. <em>On the Origin of Species</em>, covered by Richard Dawkins. <em>Twilight</em>, covered by Margaret Atwood. Covers like these do exist, but too few. A few months ago I <a href="https://twitter.com/davidklaing/status/1158132219484893184">tweeted</a> about this idea, and Kevin Simler <a href="https://twitter.com/KevinSimler/status/1158136084951261185">boosted</a> it to his 16,000 followers, asking for examples<sup>1</sup>. Here are some good ones:</p><ul><li>Hunter S. Thompson covered parts of The Great Gatsby. According to Louis Menand’s <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2005/03/07/believer">obituary of Thompson</a> in <em>The New Yorker</em>, Thompson “used to type out pages from <em>The Great Gatsby</em>, just to get the feeling, he said, of what it was like to write that way”.</li><li>Benjamin Franklin covered articles in the <em>Spectator</em>. He says in his <a href="https://www.ushistory.org/franklin/autobiography/page06.htm">autobiography</a>, “I took some of the papers, and making short hints of the sentiment in each sentence, laid them by a few days, and then, without looking at the book, tried to complete the papers again, by expressing each hinted sentiment at length, and as fully as it had been expressed before, in any suitable words that should come to hand.”</li><li>Visakan Veerasamy <a href="http://www.visakanv.com/blog/politics-and-the-english-language/">covered</a> George Orwell’s essay, “Politics and the English Language”. He says in an introductory comment, “The following is my attempt to update George Orwell’s essay <a href="http://www.orwell.ru/library/essays/politics/english/e_polit/">Politics and the English Language (1946)</a> for modern reading. I’ve tried to follow his own principles to make his words sharper and clearer where I can.”</li></ul><p>Look, I get it: we want to be recognized for our own ideas. And when the original source material is just a hyperlink away, why go to the trouble of paraphrasing it? One reason is that it challenges you to internalize the original author’s way of thinking. It is the deepest possible way to read a text. Another reason is that if you choose texts that are hard to paraphrase, you will stretch yourself to reproduce material that is beyond your current ability to create from scratch. This will expand the range of what you <em>can</em> create from scratch. Lastly, covers are good for readers, too: they provide new vantage points on the underlying ideas. Reading multiple versions of a text is like seeing its underlying ideas with binocular vision.</p><p>Covers exist in other domains too: scientists reproduce other scientists’ experiments; chefs reproduce other chefs’ recipes; painters reproduce other painters’ paintings. If you’re a writer, why not try your hand at reproducing another writer’s work? I’ve been doing this for the past few months. Here are a few examples:</p><ul><li><a class="internal-link" href="/deep-laziness/" id="deep-laziness">Deep Laziness — Sarah Perry</a></li><li><a class="internal-link" href="/solved-conversations/" id="solved-conversations">Solved conversations — Aaron Z. Lewis</a></li><li><a class="internal-link" href="/research-as-a-stochastic-decision-process/" id="research-as-a-stochastic-decision-process">Research as a stochastic decision process — Jacob Steinhardt</a></li></ul><p>It’s been great exercise for my writing muscles, and I now have enough “original”<sup>2</sup> ideas to last me several blog posts. Even if those ideas run dry, I don’t have to worry about writer’s block. If my own ideas aren’t flowing, I can just cover someone else’s.</p><hr><p>1. There is another whole category of examples that exist almost by luck: translations. If it weren’t for the fact that many of the greatest works of literature were composed in languages other than our own, we might not get to enjoy them as much as we do. Nobody would be iterating on the language. A few notable examples:</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23198296-beowulf">Beowulf</a>, translated by none other than J.R.R. Tolkien.</li><li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39800574-ursula-k-le-guin-yorumuyla-tao-te-ching">The Tao Te Ching</a>, translated by Ursula K. Le Guin, the renowned science fiction writer.</li><li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20518872-the-three-body-problem">The Three-Body Problem</a>, translated by Ken Liu. It is <a href="https://www.wired.com/2016/10/wired-book-club-ken-liu-interview/">potentially even better</a> in English than in Liu Cixin’s original Chinese.</li><li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34068470-the-odyssey">The Odyssey</a>, translated by Emily Wilson. <a href="https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2018/11/best-book-2018.html">Says</a> Tyler Cowen, “It is a joy to read, the best of the five translations I know, and it has received <a href="https://www.google.com/search?source=hp&amp;ei=uyf5W6KdI87QrgS54pnQBQ&amp;q=emily+wilson+homer+review&amp;btnK=Google+Search&amp;oq=emily+wilson+homer+review&amp;gs_l=psy-ab.3...66238.70838..71982...0.0..0.0.0.......0....1..gws-wiz.....0.">strong reviews</a> from scholars for its accuracy and fidelity.”</li></ul><p>2. As Veerasamy pointed out to me when I asked him about his cover of Orwell, even original creations are really just “assemblages of micro-covers” anyway.

    content: '<div class="article-component"><h1>If you’re good, you need to talk more</h1><hr/><em>Last updated 2019-07-09</em><hr/><p>One evening last fall, I was invited to play a board game called <a class="external-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Resistance-Avalon-Social-Deduction-Game/dp/B009SAAV0C" target="_self">Avalon</a>. The game is a contest between a good team and a bad team. Through a series of public and private votes and discussion at the table, the bad people try to masquerade as good, while the good try to figure out who is good and who is bad.</p><p>I was assigned to the good team. I was the only one in the group who had never played before, so I took a backseat for the first few rounds, speaking little. To my surprise, this caused many players to suspect that I was bad.</p><p>“If you’re good,” <a class="external-link" href="https://twitter.com/kevinakwok" target="_self">one of them</a> said to me, “you need to talk more.”</p><p>I protested that bad people can speak just as easily as good people. How could I convince other players to trust me when any word I said might be a lie?</p><p>What I had failed to understand was that because of the burden of deception, talking is much more cognitively demanding for the bad people than for the good. It’s hard to maintain a consistent lie over the course of the whole game. This means that the best strategy for those on the good team is to consistently share their own thoughts and solicit those of all others. Not only does this shine a harsh light on the liars, but it also makes a greater amount of true information available for all good players to reason with.</p><p><em>If you’re good, you need to talk more.</em> I’ve come to realize that this idea goes far beyond the game of Avalon. In many facets of our lives, we draw from and contribute to an epistemic commons—a shared set of beliefs and norms that help us predict and understand the world and each other. In each facet, whether familial, social, professional, or civic, our lives are better when the epistemic commons is filled with true beliefs and productive norms. In fact, a healthy commons, with its high levels of mutual trust and perceived alignment, has the power to make our lives <em>much</em> better. Consider the expressive freedom and the unguardedness that were unlocked in the blossoming of your closest friendships.</p><p>But there are many ways the epistemic commons can become unhealthy. Like in Avalon, many groups of people contain bad actors who corrupt the commons for their own gain. Not only that, but the commons can degrade even without bad actors, simply because the world is complex and ever-changing. Ideas don’t have to be true to be catchy, and so misconceptions can spread through the commons like viruses.</p><p>What I came to understand after playing Avalon that night is that the health of an epistemic commons is maintained only under the active stewardship of good people—people who want to discover the truth and share it, who want their communities to operate under norms that allow everyone to flourish.</p><p>You might say that good stewardship isn’t so much about talking more as it is knowing when <em>not</em> to talk. You might say that it is often ineffectual, and sometimes counterproductive, to opine on subjects in which you are uninformed or undecided. Many of us have internalized the idea that we need to do our homework and think through our positions carefully before sharing, so that we don’t waste everyone’s time and attention.</p><p>I can certainly empathize with this view. If you’re like me, you often attend work meetings in which you feel doubtful of arguments people make. In these meetings I find it challenging to speak my mind, especially when I need to expend a lot of energy just to understand other people’s perspectives, let alone feel confident in my own.</p><p>But I have learned, through feedback and experience, that the less confident I am in my opinion, the <em>more</em> important it is for me to speak up. I think this is because when I’m feeling uncertain, it’s likely that other people are too. The more confident voices tend to dominate the conversation, and everyone else tends to nod along or just sit in silence. It’s far better to say “I don’t think I agree with this view, but I need some time to think about why” than to say nothing and <em>then</em> go off and do your homework. Silence is tacit agreement with the consensus. Revealing your uncertainty in real time helps to forestall harmful misunderstandings.</p><p>Moreover, whatever thoughts and ideas you do have, even if they are insufficient to solve the problem at hand, can provide scaffolding for others to find a solution. Assuming that others are searching for mutually beneficial ideas, why not provide them with as much data as possible?</p><p>Not everyone should adopt the “talk more” philosophy, of course. But I think many people are like me: they tend to err on the side of undersharing rather than oversharing. So, to those people: if you’re good, you need to talk more! Here are some concrete ways I’m doing this in my own life:</p><ol><li>Making an effort to be as open and responsive as possible with loved ones: reaching out more, responding faster, expressing dissatisfaction more readily, and offering praise whenever it occurs to me. I don’t think I had problems in this area before, but I believe that explicitly aspiring to this behavior has made me a better friend and partner.</li><li>Redistributing speaking time to quieter people when group conversations become lopsided. I’ve heard it said that if you’re in a conversation with one other person you should aim to speak 50% of the time. This generalizes well: in a conversation with five people, speak 20% of the time; with ten people, 10%; etc. When the Gini coefficient gets too high, be a conversational Robin Hood.</li><li>Being more vocal at work: speaking up more in meetings, writing more thorough documentation, leaving more detailed comments in code reviews, and sharing links that are relevant to company projects in the #random Slack channel. I work at a startup that seems poised to do big things, so I think my communicativeness within the company is one of the best opportunities I currently have to make a difference in the world.</li><li>Participating more actively on Twitter. This means writing more Tweets of my own, responding more frequently to others, and being more liberal in my use of the ‘like’ button. Like anyone, I need to be careful not to get too engrossed by social media, but having put some effort into curating my feed, I find that Twitter is a predominantly positive thing in my life.</li><li>Writing more blog posts<strong>.</strong> Writing takes a lot of work, and more often than not, what I write doesn’t bring me much recognition. But occasionally I hear a word or two of thanks for sharing an idea that helped or stimulated someone, and this is enough to convince me that my efforts are worthwhile.</li></ol><p>The sixth is still aspirational, but will hopefully be realized soon: play Avalon again! I’ve bought the game, but have yet to take the initiative to bring together enough people to play. Beyond the fact that it’s an absolute blast, I’ve been told there’s an additional benefit to playing regularly: you learn what it looks like when a person is trying to sabotage the commons rather than nourish it.</p><p>Luckily, real life is rarely as adversarial as Avalon, so we don’t usually need to be so suspicious of those around us. But I know of no experience that better demonstrates the challenges of collaborative truth-seeking, and the responsibility of good people to talk more.</p><hr><p>Thanks to Kevin Kwok for inspiring this post and for his insightful feedback on it. Thanks also to Meg Inman, Matthew Jordan, and Kevin Simler for their valuable feedback on earlier drafts.</p></hr></div>'

    content: '<div class="article-component"><h1>Communication in data science is more than just the final report</h1><hr/><em>Last updated 2017-11-10</em><hr/><p><em>Cross-posted from the <a href="https://ubc-mds.github.io/2017-11-10-DSCI-542-communication/">UBC MDS blog</a></em>.</p><hr><p>When people stress the importance of good communication in data science, they are usually saying something like what Hadley Wickham says in his book <a href="https://r4ds.had.co.nz/communicate-intro.html">R for Data Science</a>: “[It] doesn’t matter how great your analysis is unless you can explain it to others: you need to communicate your results.” In other words, good communication is crucial to data science because it is the final step, without which all prior work would be wasted.</p><p>But communication is even more important than that. If you fail to communicate well with your client at the beginning of a project, you may waste your efforts answering the wrong question. If you fail to communicate well with your team, you may create inefficiencies in your workflow. And if you fail to communicate well with your future self, through careful documentation and clean code, you may find yourself circling back to redo old work. Communication is of course important at the end of the project too, but it’s more than just a final bottleneck; it’s important at every stage.</p><p>I had in mind this view of communication in data science when I designed DSCI 542: Communication &amp; Argumentation, a four-week course that students take in their first month of the UBC Master of Data Science (MDS) program. My goal was to prepare students for the wide variety of communication-related challenges they will face as data scientists. This was hard because these challenges vary in so many ways – by medium, by audience, by purpose. One day you’re explaining a new algorithm to your manager; another day you’re messaging a co-worker over Slack to try to fix a bug; another day you’re presenting the results of your analysis to a room full of decision-makers. So, rather than trying to prescribe specific strategies for communicating well in every conceivable scenario, I aimed to help the students discover a few key principles that apply across all data science communication.</p><p>The most important of these principles is a consequence of what psychologists call the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curse_of_knowledge">curse of knowledge</a>: the fact that when you know something, it is nearly impossible to imagine what it is like not to know it. In a classic experiment, subjects are privately told the title of a popular song, and asked to clap (but not sing or hum) its chorus. They then predict whether another person in the room, who wasn’t told the title of the song, would be able to guess it. Time and again, the people who clap the song overestimate other people’s ability to guess it. The clapper can hear the music in their head; the listener can hear only a disconnected, rhythmic skeleton.</p><p>Because of the curse of knowledge, a communicator’s first instinct is often to provide their audience with precise but abstract details about the subject at hand. The communicator queries their own mind for the phrase, “confidence interval”, and they come up with something like, “an interval estimate of a parameter of a statistical model.” This is fine if the audience already knows what a confidence interval is, but it’s gibberish if they don’t. Herein lies the biggest challenge in communication. It’s not enough to simply understand a subject and be able to produce true sentences about it. A skilled communicator must be able to craft each part of their message in anticipation of the audience’s state of mind.</p><p>So, what is the principle here? “Know about the curse of knowledge, and don’t let it get you”? Unfortunately, naming the problem is not the same as solving it. In our class this year, the best solution that the students and I discovered was to explain concepts from the bottom up rather than from the top down. Let me show you two examples to illustrate what I mean. Here is a top-down explanation of the difference between statistics and probability:</p><blockquote><p>Statistical inference aims to characterize data-generating processes, usually based on samples of observations. In contrast, probabilistic inference aims to determine how likely it is that an event will occur. While statistical inference works backward from data to say something about the conditions that produced it, probabilistic inference works forward from a supposed set of conditions to predict which data will be produced next.</p></blockquote><p>A top-down explanation provides information that is mentally proximate to the concept. The information is general and abstract – a Platonic approach.</p><p>In contrast, here is a bottom-up explanation:</p><blockquote><p>Suppose I have a bag that contains 1000 balls, and each ball is either blue or red. If I know the proportion of balls that are red, then I can compute the probability that a randomly selected ball will turn out to be red. But if I don’t know the proportion of red balls, I will have to estimate it through repeated samples, using statistics. Probabilistic inference uses my assumptions to predict my observations; statistical inference uses my observations to refine my assumptions.</p></blockquote><p>A bottom-up explanation starts with examples, allowing the abstraction and generality to emerge out of concreteness and specificity.</p><p>There are tradeoffs between these approaches, of course. Top-down explanations are useful within intellectual communities because they make it easier to build on prior abstractions. But data science is so interdisciplinary, and has so much contact with people outside the field, that bottom-up explanations are almost always best.</p><p>Throughout the four weeks of the course, we examined other communication-related challenges that frequently occur across data science work:</p><ul><li>how to be an effective consumer of data science communication</li><li>how to apply principles of narrative, and how to reason about its risks</li><li>how spot the advantages and disadvantages of a given medium of communication, such as prose, speech, code, or mathematical notation</li><li>how to connect the statistical language of variables and values to the practical concerns of decision-makers</li><li>how to connect the quantified form of uncertainty that results from statistical modelling to the subjective form of uncertainty that people experience in everyday life</li></ul><p>It was a privilege to teach this course. The students approached the lessons and assignments with enthusiasm and insight, and I am proud of what they achieved. I hope that they will begin their data science careers with not just the ability to share the results of their analyses, but with the ability to approach all data science communication with sound strategies and a good understanding of the principles at play.</p></hr></div>'

    content: '<div class="article-component"><h1>How to get a job in data science</h1><hr/><em>Last updated 2019-04-11</em><hr/><p>It is said that when you give the same advice three times, you should write it down in a blog post. I’m often approached for advice by job seekers in data science, so this is that blog post.</p><p>When a company hires someone, they want to know that the person 1) <em>can</em> and 2) <em>will</em> do the job. Most people’s résumés do extremely little on their own to inspire this confidence, especially in a tough job market. The good news is, you have options. You just have to display patent evidence of your <strong>skills</strong> (whether you can do the job) and your <strong>character</strong> (whether you will do it).</p><p>The best way to create evidence of your skills is to use them and then share the artifacts of your work.</p><p>One option is to do a project that is targeted at the company you want to work for. Read the job posting carefully to figure out what the job is, and then spend a weekend putting together a small project that demonstrates your ability to do it.</p><p>If you’re lucky, the posting will include details about a take-home assessment that will be required as part of the interview process. 99% of people who apply to the position will just submit a résumé and a boiler-plate cover letter; they wouldn’t dream of doing the take-home assessment before even getting a first interview. So a great way to stand out is to do the project preemptively and send it in.</p><p>Another option is to come up with a project of your own. Some people will say not to try Kaggle contests because <em>everyone</em> does Kaggle contests. I’m not convinced of that advice. The first step is to do something, anything at all. If Kaggle seems fun to you, go for it. Another option is to pick a textbook and start reading it. Summarize a chapter or two and share what you’ve learned online. You don’t need to be original. You just need to be more generative than the average job-seeker.</p><p>The strongest evidence of your character is in your current relationships. That’s why referrals are best sought from the people you already know, especially people you’ve known for a long time or worked with previously. If you haven’t already, I recommend that you tell everyone you know that you’re looking for work.</p><p>If this avenue dries up, you may need to get to know new people. If you’re sharing high-quality work online, you will be more likely to make serendipitous connections. Beyond that, you may decide to go to some meetups or conferences. This can work well if you’re strategic. You want to draw <em>some</em> attention to yourself, especially from people who might potentially hire or refer you, but it has to be the right kind of attention. You don’t want to just wander from person to person telling them you’re looking for work. A better strategy is to ask a thoughtful question during a talk. This will give people an ice-breaker so that they can come talk to <em>you</em>. And in the mingling sessions, just ask lots of questions and listen to the answers.</p><p>I don’t think résumés or cover letters matter very much. One page, two pages—who cares? Just make sure there are no glaring typos, that you summarize your qualifications, and that there is information about where to learn more about you—LinkedIn, GitHub, your website, etc. Don’t go overboard describing your skills, especially soft skills. Anybody can write that stuff on a résumé, so it doesn’t convey much information.</p><p>Most of what I’ve said applies to any job search. What about in data science specifically? What should you know, and how can you stand out? I’ll answer these questions by offering three examples of interview questions that I think would do a good job of assessing a potential data scientist, along with what I would hope to see in a candidate’s answer.</p><blockquote><p>You work for a bank, and you’ve been asked to write a Python or R package to facilitate ongoing analysis of online surveys which are sent to customers every time they visit a branch in person. What first steps would you take to ensure that this project is successful? Be specific: what is on your to-do list for the first couple days of package development?</p></blockquote><p>This question has two purposes. The first is to get a sense of your project management skills. How deeply do you try to understand a problem before you start executing on a solution? How do you budget your time and figure out the scope of your responsibilities? How do you forestall unneeded risks or costs?</p><p>The second purpose is to gauge your level of experience as a developer. Do you know how to set up the right directory structure? Will you use a git branching model? How will you track dependencies? Do you have a preferred testing framework?  Will you set up continuous integration? Will you set up git hooks or some other system to auto-generate documentation? These things are the bread and butter of many data science jobs.</p><blockquote><p>A senior executive at your company has heard that one of your models, which uses the k-nearest neighbors algorithm to predict house prices, involves something called a “bias-variance tradeoff”. They want to know what this tradeoff is, and also why your algorithm seems to depend so much on “neighboring” houses, when there ought to be other relevant factors to consider. How would you explain?</p></blockquote><p>Data scientists frequently need to explain their work to decision-makers or stakeholders, and this often involves disambiguating technical terms. This question presents an opportunity to give a vivid explanation of the bias-variance tradeoff by relating it to a hyperparameter (<em>k</em>) in a relatively simple algorithm. It also tests your ability to explain, tactfully and clearly, what is meant by “neighbor” if not the traditional meaning. My advice to you for answering questions like this one is to ground your explanation in a <a href="https://davidklaing.com/blog/2017/11/10/communication-in-data-science.html">concrete example</a>.</p><blockquote><p>You work for a company that offers a subscription-based meditation app. You have behavioral data about each user – how often they open the app, which pages they visit, etc. After creating around 20 features, one of your colleagues built a multiple logistic regression model to predict whether a user will cancel their subscription in the next month. They found that just one behavior has a statistically significant relationship with cancellation: the frequency at which the user opens the app before 9:00am. Your colleague is proposing that a notification be sent by default every morning, and wants to know your thoughts. What questions would you ask about their analysis, and what do you think of their conclusion?</p></blockquote><p>Some findings are surprising because you’ve done your job well: you uncovered something that wasn’t obvious. Some findings are surprising because they’re wrong. One of the biggest challenges in data science, especially for junior data scientists, is distinguishing between these two cases. This question challenges you to recognize the importance of correcting for multiple comparisons, considering effect sizes, choosing the right model, and testing out small-scale interventions before committing to big ones.</p><p>Interviews are hard, and they take practice. Try not to get discouraged if you get turned down—it happens to everyone. But if you keep learning, keep sharing your work online, and maintain good relationships with the people in your network, I’m confident that you’ll find work.</p></div>'

    content: '<div class="article-component"><h1>The personal PhD</h1><hr/><em>Last updated 2019-07-16</em><hr/><p>Lots of people aspire to do a “personal master’s degree,” but I’ve never seen anyone describe an attempt to do a “personal PhD.” With the caveat that I haven’t done a PhD myself, it appears to me that many components of it are achievable outside a traditional program. I think people who are drawn to PhD programs should consider whether they can assemble the key ingredients on their own.</p><p>As far as I can tell, these are the key ingredients:</p><ol><li>A broad understanding of the history and methods of your discipline, and a deep, constantly renewing understanding of a specialty within that discipline.</li><li>Several peer-reviewed publications.</li><li>Frequent feedback from an expert mentor over a period of several years.</li><li>Extensive experience teaching and evaluating beginners.</li><li>Completion and publication of a large research project that makes an original contribution.</li></ol><p>None of these things are easy to do outside a PhD program, but they’re all possible. You can learn independently: materials are abundant and usually free, so in many disciplines the only barriers to understanding are time and discipline. You can publish papers in industry journals or conference proceedings. You can find an expert mentor. You can volunteer to lead workshops, or find a part-time teaching position. And as long as you can acquire the tools and the data, you can do original research.</p><p>Of course, people consider doing PhDs for different reasons. Different end-goals may call for different mixtures of ingredients. But if you’re considering one at all, it’s worth asking yourself: for whichever parts of the experience are most appealing to you, is there a DIY version that might be just as good?</p></div>'
