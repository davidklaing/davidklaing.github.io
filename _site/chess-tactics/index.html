            <p>1. If your opponent exposes their queen in the opening, trade queens with them to prevent them from castling. (It took me SO LONG to understand why people kept doing that to me.)</p>

<p>2. Two pawns on the sixth rank is worth at least a rook. In the position below, white is going to dominate.</p>

<p>3. Look for forks. A fork is a move that attacks two pieces simultaneously. In the position below, white’s knight attacks black’s bishop and rook at the same time.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="/assets/img/chess/forks.png" width="70%" /></p>

<p>4. Look for pins. A pin is a move that traps a valuable piece behind a less valuable one. In the position below, black’s G pawn is “pinned”. It can’t advance or capture the queen because white’s bishop is x-raying black’s king.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="/assets/img/chess/pins.png" width="70%" /></p>

<p>5. Look for skewers. A skewer is a move that forces a valuable piece to move out of the way, allowing the capture of a less valuable piece. In the position below, black has skewered white’s king, allowing black to capture white’s queen.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="/assets/img/chess/skewers.png" width="70%" /></p>

<p>6. In a queen-only checkmate, back your opponent’s king into a corner by successively moving your queen so that it is a knight’s-move away from their king. Then bring your king over to support your queen in the checkmate.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="/assets/img/chess/queen_checkmate.png" width="90%" /></p>

<p>7. In a two-rook checkmate, roll their king across the board one rank or file at a time.</p>

Don’t try to psych your opponent out by playing really fast. It might work, but only on weak players, and either way you’ll lose an opportunity to learn.</p><p>3. Don’t get too hung up on your Elo rating. Play chess (the game), not Elo (the meta-game).</p><p>4. If you’re on a losing streak, take a break. Don’t play rage-chess. I don’t always follow this advice myself…</p><p>5. If someone tries to taunt you or insult you in the chat, do your best to ignore it and just play your game. Should go without saying, but don’t taunt others.</p><p>6. Unless you’re Magnus Carlsen, don’t take any of this too seriously. (Easier said than done! My favourite chess quote: “Every chess player should have a hobby.”)</p><p>7. Don’t copy your opponent’s moves. If someone does this to you, don’t get psyched out; after all, it means your opponent is letting you do their thinking for them. Just look for your opportunity.</p>'
