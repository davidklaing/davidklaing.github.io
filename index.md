Welcome! I'm <a id="about-me" class="internal-link" href="/about-me/">David Laing</a>. I write to share my learning, to give more life to ideas that I think are underappreciated, and to make it easier for my future friends to find me. Perhaps you are one of them? Say hello on <a class="external-link" target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/davidklaing">Twitter</a>, or subscribe to my <a class="external-link" target="_blank" href="https://davidlaing.substack.com">monthly newsletter</a>.

Best of:
