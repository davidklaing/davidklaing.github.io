But there’s more to it than that:</p><ul><li><a class="internal-link" href="/affective-states-diffuse/" id="affective-states-diffuse">Affective states diffuse across time and across people</a></li><li><a class="internal-link" href="/learning-happens-faster-when-it-is-pleasurable/" id="learning-happens-faster-when-it-is-pleasurable">Learning happens faster when it is pleasurable</a></li></ul><p>The way to maximize pleasure is not to maximize pleasure at every single moment. This would lead to a downward spiral into behaviors that have delayed costs. Instead:</p><ul><li>Eliminate flow-stoppers</li><li>Create pleasurable rituals</li><li>Adopt a non-instrumental mindset</li><li>Connect new experiences to known sources of pleasure</li></ul></div>'
